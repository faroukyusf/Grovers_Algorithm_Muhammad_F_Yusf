Introducing and implementing Grover's search algorithm for N qubit system.

The problem of searching for a desired input among N inputs can be classically solved via doing O(N) operations, on average N/2, and it even can take very long time to be solved in some situations of largeenough N. However, this problem can be solved via applying O[sqrt(N)] operations by the means of a quantum mechanical search algorithm, known as “Grover’s Algorithm”. 

In this project, I will introduce a methodology to search for a single value in an N-Qubit system –taking a 3-Qubit system as an illustration—, via building a quantum circuit step-by-step. First, some basic definitions are stated in order to be used in building the circuit. Second, a comprehensive methodology to how exactly such circuit can be built and a full code will be used. Finally, there is a discussion upon the number of iterations and the efficiency of such a quantum mechanical circuit.

Cridts: This could not have been accomplished without the cooperation of Ammar El-Laboudy and Fahmy Yousry.
